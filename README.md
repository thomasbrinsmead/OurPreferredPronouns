**Notes:** Any of the forms in Table 1 is permissible, though must be locally consistent. Multiple forms within the same text are permitted to make distinctions along a proximity spectrum (proximate to obviative), or simply to distinguish referents without implying any particular relative or absolute proximity. 

Impermissible initial consonants: b- too existential, bh- too Irish, c- too French, f- too feminine, gl- too Italian, h- too masculine, k- too weird, l- too French definite, ll- too Welsh, m- too primary, mh- too Irish, n- too negative, p- too boring, ph- too fricative, s- too French, sh- too feminine, th- too secondary and too plural, v- too Germanic primary, w- too German primary

Additional notes: Our majestic Excellencies Ourselves do not consent to being referred to in the plural by others (eg the second or third person plural), except in accordance with the capitalised honorific formulation of row 32 of Table 1, or if referred to by clearly self-identifying nonpersons. However, We may refer to Ourselves in the plural first person, where capitalisation can disambguate this pluralis excellentiarum from the plural. Thou is welcome to address Us in the second person by thou, thee, thy, thine, thyself (see above on plural pronouns) and We Ourselves would prefer the variants of Eower majestic Excellencies rather than Your majestic Excellencies if thou accords with the form of row 32. In general, I do not approve of the use of plural pronouns to refer to individual persons except in the above cases. The obvious variants of tikkitikkitembonosarembocharybaryruchipipperipembofintimlinbinwhinbimlimbusstopftangfrtangolebiscuitbarrellchingchonghonglongfong (uncapitalised) as a pronoun, or changu, changum, changu’s, changus, changusself, are also acceptable. Suggested additions to the list of options are welcome, but not necessarily encouraged. 

Beyond my/Our/Our majestic Excellencies' personal pronouns, recommendations for exclusive and inclusive first person plural are with initial consonants "tkh-" and "v-" respectively, inspired by Chechen. To differentiate exclusive and inclusive or, I/We/Our majestic Excellencies recommend "vor" and "tor" respectively, inspired by Finnish. Sorry about the reversal. #Saussure, #arbitrary
